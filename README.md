## Data and API Caching

- PokeAPI JSON resources are cached locally with IndexedDB, with an in-memory fallback for the current session.
- Repeated Pokemon, Pokedex, type, move, species, evolution, and ability requests reuse cached data when available.
- Local app progress such as the TCG collection and Who's That Pokemon leaderboard remains saved in browser storage.

## About

Personal project, not intended for commercial use — just something I wanted to build to study React. AI coding tools such as Codex were used during development.
